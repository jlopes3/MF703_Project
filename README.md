## Abstract/Introduction
With the United States presidential elections becoming increasingly polarized, many citizens express concerns about the country's future. Gerardo Manzo, in his study, highlights how Italian financial markets respond to politically charged events This repository uses Manzo's analysis as motivation to analyze market volatility during United States election cycles and leverage this volatility to construct high-performing investment portfolios.


We begin by defining the election period: for this analysis, it includes the 26 weeks preceding an election and the 2 weeks following it. We then examine whether market volatility during these periods is significantly higher compared to similar timeframes in non-election years. Finally, we collect data on multiple assets and apply portfolio optimization techniques to explore potential performance improvements.

Accompanying paper will be pushed to the repository by December 8th, 2024
